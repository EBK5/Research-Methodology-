\centerline{ROAD ACCIDENTS IN UGANDA}

\section{Idea}
In this project which is create an automated system that can help reduce or deal away with the number of road accidents in Uganda. A monitoring system in the form of cameras that are put besides roads after every given number of kilometres on a specific road that would be used to monitor the speeds at which drivers would drive and in case of over speeding, a nearby patrol can go in pursue of the vehicle as well as all those other cases such as drunk driving, overloading and so many others. The system would be in such a way that all these cameras on a specific road have a control station and possible several patrol cars on that very road so in case of any vehicle that out of control, the patrol nearest to the possible cause of accident can pursue the vehicle and either charge them or stop their movement. When this is done to most roads in Uganda ,it would help a lot in making drivers respect road signs, and all the traffic rules in fear of being charged of journey cancelled or delayed thus reducing or solving the problem of road accidents.
