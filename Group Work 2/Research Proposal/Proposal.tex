\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Background}
\paragraph{•}
Barely two months after 13 Tanzanian nationals perished on the Kampala-Masaka highway after attending a wedding in Kamoala, one Ugandan has died and three others were badly injured in an accident, on same road. Eye witnesses said the speeding FUSO truck lost control in a "dangerous spot" and swayed towards the side of the oncoming Saloon car, causing the crash at about 10:00pm. The car was damaged beyond repair. The driver of the Sallon car was travelling together with three passengers when this occurred. The three sustained serious injuries while the driver died on the scene. 
\paragraph{•}
Though the cause of the accident is still being investigated, road accidents have claimed the lives of many individuals, and is among the leading causes of injuries that are treated in a very odd way. Low income countries (LIC) and middle income countries (MIC) populations are faced with more road deaths than the high income countries (HIC) but all are as much affected.
\paragraph{•}
Regardless of what level of income an individual is, all road users are at risk of this endemic. The most hurting accidents are those that claim the life of children or pedestrians who are caught in the indiscipline of drivers to keep or maintain traffic rules. 
\paragraph{•}
Research has it that there are very many causes for road accidents; including - driver's age, weather, road conditions, driver's sex, drunkenness, attitudes of drivers and so on. Traffic experts agree that a good driving attitude-more than driving skill-can keep you out of most accident-producing situations from which not even the most skillful driver could escape without injury or property loss. By observation, taxi drivers are well known for exhibiting a very bad attitude while driving. All these causes of accidents can be categorized as human error, environment factors and vehicle factors.
