\textbf{AUTOMATED SPEEDING DETECTOR ALONG ROADS TO CURB INCREASING ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS IN UGANDA IN VIEW OF TAXI DRIVERS}\\
\end{center}

\section{Background}
\paragraph{•}
Although eyewitnesses, news articles and many police reports, usually account for collusions to driver responsibility; including - negligence, reckless driving, inexperienced driving, over speeding and so on; various scientific studies (Brown and Bohnert 1968; Odero, Garner and Zwi, 1997; Peltzer, 2008; Selzer and Vinokur, 1974; WHO, 2004; Yaşar, 2007) have traditionally categorised accident occurance but not limited it to; human error, environment factors and vehicle factors.

\section{Problem Statement}
\paragraph{•}
Even though, road accidents are the source of so many deaths and so many other serious and not so serious injuries there are treated in a very odd way. All road users are at risk of this endemic but taxi drivers are as more prone to perishing and /or sustain severe fractures/disabilities in road traffic accidents as the number of passenger routes they drive daily. Thus, road traffic accidents stay a soaring health problem in Uganda, the world over. In this study, many accidents due to taxi drivers is because of over speeding.
  
\section{Main Objective}
\paragraph{•}
To develop an Automated Speed Detector to be placed along roads with speed limits to curb speeding taxi drivers along dark spots.

\section{Methods}
\paragraph{•}
The data and information that will be used in conducting this research study will include both primary and secondary data which involves personal observation, book, journals, company, documents, internet downloads and a number of others white ups and presentations which are relevant to this study.
